# 1. CHANGE the default password before production deployment
# 2. Use a secrets manager (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
# 3. Make regular backups of the master password
# 4. Consider regular rotation of the master password
# 5. Monitor encryption logs to detect anomalies

# =============================================================================
# USEFUL COMMANDS

# To generate a new secure password:
# openssl rand -base64 32

# To verify configuration:
# pnpm dev and check logs on first upload
